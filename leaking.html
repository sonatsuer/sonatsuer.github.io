<h1 class="title">Leaking Implementation Details (For
Mathematicians)</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>You are in your office, trying to teach how to evaluate <span
class="math inline">\(\int \sin^2(x)\cos^3(x)dx\)</span> to a pre-med
student. Suddenly you hear someone scream: <em>“Implementation details
are leaking!”</em> The pre-med and you look at each other with puzzled
eyes. Then you hear it again: <em>“It is everywhere! It even got into
the specs!”</em> This time you recognize the voice. It is your computer
scientist friend from across the hallway. You put your hand on the
shoulder of the pre-med and say <em>“You are right kiddo. You will be a
real doctor, you don’t need any of these…”</em> and leave the room to
help your friend. However, there is a small problem. Being a
mathematician, you do not know what it means to leak implementation
details.</p>
<p>So you call me and I tell you this:</p>
<h2 id="examples-from-mathematics">Examples from mathematics</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with a somewhat strange question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> a subset of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our gut feeling tells us that this is absurd and one shouldn’t ask
such questions even though it is formally valid in a foundational theory
in which all objects are sets, such as ZFC. There is one context,
however, in which this question may come up. If you are teaching an
introductory course in real analysis and you are constructing real
numbers as left Dedekind cuts then, since the order on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is given by inclusion, you may
ask whether <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is a subset of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> as a sanity check. After this course,
your students should of course forget about how the reals are
constructed and refer to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>
as a complete ordered field.</p>
<p>This practice is very common in programming, too. For a programmer,
Dedekind reals are an implementation and the axioms of the complete
ordered fields form an API, that is an <em>application program
interface</em> together with a specification. We interact with reals
only through these axioms. So the fact that inclusion is the order
relation on Dedekind reals is an implementation detail, and if you use
this fact while doing real analysis then you are leaking an
implementation detail.</p>
<p>This particular example seems very intuitive but there are more
subtle cases. Thinking in terms of an API and a specification instead of
a fixed implementation, also known as abstract thinking, can be tricky
especially when the problem at hand is presented in terms of a concrete
implementation. To illustrate the point, I will talk about two
problems.</p>
<p>Here is the first one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there an embedding of <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R},
\leq)\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\((\wp(\mathbb{N}),
\subseteq )\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\wp\)</span>
stands for power set?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is yes and the proof is easy, though I have seen students
as well as professional mathematicians being surprised by this fact. I
believe the reason is that <span
class="math inline">\(\wp(\mathbb{N})\)</span> has a discrete
<em>feeling</em> to it as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is discretely ordered. So one
expects that it cannot contain a copy of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. However <span
class="math inline">\(\wp\)</span> does not use the order structure on
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\wp(\mathbb{N})\)</span> is isomorphic to <span
class="math inline">\(\wp(A)\)</span> for any countably infinite set
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In that regard, choice of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is an implementation detail
and the source of confusion seems to be the fact that it is leaking at a
pedagogical level. If the answer is still not clear after this
discussion, just use Dedekind cuts with <span
class="math inline">\(\wp(\mathbb{Q})\)</span>.</p>
<p>The second question is a little famous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given two dice <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with arbitrary natural numbers on their
faces, we say that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> beats <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> if, when rolled together, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is more likely to be higher than <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Can we have three dice <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> beats <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
beats <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> beats <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question, which is much more counterintuitive, is
also yes. Actually here is an example: <span class="math display">\[
A\colon 2,2,4,4,9,9;\;\; B\colon 1,1,6,6,8,8;\;\; C\colon 3,3,5,5,7,7.
\]</span> More than once I have seen people claiming that this is
impossible by arguing that the expected values would violate
transitivity of the order relation on reals. The problem with this
argument, other than being false, is that expected value is meaningful
for <em>numbers</em> as it involves an average. However, when you look
at the statement of the problem you see that only the order on natural
numbers is used so one could formulate the question with any infinite
linearly ordered set. So using structure other than the order is leaking
implementation details.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that putting your problem behind an
abstract API may clarify it. Mathematicians do it intuitively.
Programmers, on the other hand, usually approach the problem much more
methodically. So let’s see a toy example from programming.</p>
<h2 id="interfaces-and-haskell-smart-constructors">Interfaces and
Haskell: Smart constructors</h2>
<p>I will use the programming language Haskell trying to explain the
relevant syntax. Haskell programs are organized as trees of modules.
Each module implements some functionality. Modules can access their
child modules modules to import functionality exported by them. On the
other hand a module does not necessarily export everything it
implements. In other words, each module can define its API. This is one
of the standard ways of encapsulating implementation details. Let’s look
at a concrete example.</p>
<p>Suppose you need some sort of counter in your program that you can
increase at will. One obvious solution would be to use integers. However
integers can take negative values or we can multiply integers, which are
not really meaningful for a counter. so using naked integers is not a
good idea. Instead we will implement our counter in a module and use
integers as the underlying object but hide it from the users
outside.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about this piece of code. We define a module named <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Counter</span></code> which
defines a type named <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Counter</span></code>. The
subtlety here is that <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">MkCounter</span></code> is
<em>not</em> exported. This means that even if we can talk about values
of type <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Counter</span></code>
outside this module, we cannot use pattern match to extract the integer
inside, or put an arbitrary integer in a <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Counter</span></code>.
Instead, we have to use <code
class="sourceCode haskell">initialCounter</code> to construct a counter,
<code class="sourceCode haskell">increase</code> and <code
class="sourceCode haskell">undo</code> to manipulate counters and <code
class="sourceCode haskell">getCount</code> to access the value in the
counter. Interacting with the <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Counter</span></code> type
using only this api guarantees that the integer held by the counter is
never negative.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to introduce some terminology. The constructor
<code class="sourceCode haskell">initialCounter</code> is called a smart
constructor. The property of being nonnegative is called an invariant of
the type. The functions <code class="sourceCode haskell">increase</code>
and <code class="sourceCode haskell">undo</code> are said to preserve
the invariant. The idea is to expose a type through its smart
constructors and invariant-preserving manipulators. One can find this
idea applied in, say, the containers like maps and sets where the
underlying type is some kind of tree.</p>
<p>I should say at his point that I chose smart constructors because
they are easy to explain. They come with certain <a
href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/">caveats</a>
which I will not go into in this post. So if you decide to make use this
method take a look at the down sides. I omitted other methods like <a
href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Existentially_quantified_types">existential
types</a> which can hide everything about a type except for that it
exists and <a
href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">typeclasses</a> which
allow you to hide an entire class of structures behind an API. I also
wrote this post from a theory-free point of view but there is deep and
beautiful mathematics behind <a
href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~udr/papers/logical-relations-and-parametricity.pdf">information
hiding</a> if you are interested.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-leak-implementation-details">When to leak implementation
details</h2>
<p>After reading all these you might think that leaking implementation
details should be avoided at all costs. Well, not really. Look at these
type signatures from the <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Data.Set</span></code>
library of Haskell:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">singleton ::</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Set</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">insert ::</span> <span class="dt">Ord</span> a <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Set</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Set</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>They roughly correspond to the functions <span
class="math inline">\({\rm singleton}(x) = \{x\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\({\rm insert}(x, A) = \{x\}\cup A\)</span>. The
first signature looks okay but that <code
class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="dt">Ord</span> a</code> in the
second one looks odd. It is a typeclass constraint saying that this
function requires the type <code class="sourceCode haskell">a</code>
have a linear order on it. It is there because the underlying tree
structure has an invariant expressed in terms of an order relation: at a
branching point, all nodes on the left branch should be less then all
nodes on the right branch. It is needed for efficiency. With this
invariant, for instance, membership can be decided in logarithmic time
as opposed to linear time by employing a divide and conquer type
strategy. But this means we are letting an implementation detail leak
through the API! Of course one can build a library to represent sets
without mentioning order relations but it would be unusable because it
would be too slow. So yes, the implementation detail leaks but for a
very good reason. It is a very common theme. The initial design of a
system has clear cut abstraction boundaries but optimization –or some
other cross cutting concern– breaches those boundaries.</p>
<p>We have similar practices in mathematics, too. Sometimes we pick a
representation of an object and work with it because it is easier due to
some extra structure of the particular representation. For instance the
tension between synthetic and analytic geometry can be read as an
instance of this trade-off. Here is a somewhat advanced example.
Concrete categories, that is, categories with a faithful functor into
<span class="math inline">\({\rm Set}\)</span> are sometimes easier to
work with as element chasing arguments are available. But the standard
API of category theory has arrows but no elements. So sometimes we
employ a big theorem like the <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Freyd-Mitchell+embedding+theorem">Freyd-Mitchell
theorem</a> which, in this case,essentially says that an abelian
category can be viewed as full subcategory of an <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-module category. This allows us to use
assumptions like “morphisms are functions” which are not compatible with
the API of categories.</p>
