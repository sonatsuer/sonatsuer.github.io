<h2 id="induction-and-recursion">Induction and Recursion</h2>
<p>Recently I found lecture notes of an introductory set theory course I taught almost 10 years ago. Most of the content was pretty standard: axiom of choice, cardinal arithmetic, transfinite induction etc. But one theorem was something you would not find proved in full detail very often: equivalence of Dedekind’s definition of natural numbers and the initial algebra definition. So I decided to turn it into a blog post.</p>
<p>Let us start by setting the stage. Call a triple <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A,f,a)\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure if <span class="math inline">\(a\in A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\colon A\to A\)</span>. Note that we only specified the ‘signature’ of the structure, we are not assuming anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Proof By Iduction (PI):</strong> We will say that an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A,f,a)\)</span> <em>allows proof by induction</em> if for every <span class="math inline">\(B\subseteq A\)</span> satisfying the properties</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a\in B\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b\in B\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\in B\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>we have <span class="math inline">\(B=A\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, if you are familiar with the terminology, an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure allows <strong>PI</strong> if and only if it does not have any proper substructures. The obvious example is <span class="math inline">\((\IN, n \mapsto n + 1, 0)\)</span>. But allowing <strong>PI</strong> is a weak property in the sense that there are other models satisfying it. For instance <span class="math inline">\((\{0,1,\ldots,m\}, n \mapsto n + 1\;{\rm mod}\;m, 0)\)</span>. Dedekind’s axioms for natural numbers is a strengthening of allowing <strong>PI</strong> to eliminate finite examples like this one.</p>
<p><strong>Dedekind Axioms for Naturals (DA):</strong> For an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A,f,a)\)</span> the <em>Dedekind axioms</em> are</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> allows <strong>PI</strong>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is not in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a small warm-up, let us prove that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is actually a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\setminus\{a\}\)</span>. Define <span class="math display">\[
B = \{b\in A | b = a \text{ or } b\in{\rm Im}(f)\}.
\]</span> It is enough to show that <span class="math inline">\(B=A\)</span>. Clearly <span class="math inline">\(a\in B\)</span>. Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(b\in B\)</span>. Then, by definition, <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\in {\rm Im}(f)\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\in B\)</span>. So, by <strong>PI</strong>, we are done.</p>
<p>The second characterization of natural numbers relies on recursion.</p>
<p><strong>Definition by Recursion (DR):</strong> We will say that an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A, f, a)\)</span> <em>allows definition by recursion</em> if for any <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}=(B, g, b)\)</span> there is a unique function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\colon A\to B\)</span> such that</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varphi(a) = b\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varphi(f(x)) = g(\varphi(x))\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x\in A\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you are familiar with the terminology, an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure allows <strong>DR</strong> if and only if it is an initial object in te category of <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structures and the function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is the corresponding catamorphism.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the terminology, here is a simple example. For the moment assume that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}=(\IN, n\mapsto n + 1, 0)\)</span> allows <strong>DR</strong> –whatever you definition for <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span> is. Now consider <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}=(\IN, n\mapsto 2n, 1)\)</span>. The function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> mentioned in the <strong>DR</strong> property satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(0) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(n + 1)=2\varphi(n)\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is the function <span class="math inline">\(n\mapsto 2^n\)</span> defined by recursion.</p>
<p>In this post I will give a proof of the following theorem: An <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure allows <strong>DR</strong> if and only if it satisfies <strong>DA</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="from-dedekind-axioms-to-definition-by-recursion">From Dedekind Axioms to Definition by Recursion</h2>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A,f,a)\)</span> satisfies <strong>DA</strong> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}=(B,g,b)\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure. Call a subset <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(A\times B\)</span> a candidate relation if</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in R\)</span>,</li>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\in R\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\((f(x), g(y))\in R\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> be the set of all candidate relations. Since <span class="math inline">\(A\times B\)</span> itself is a candidate relation <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is not empty. Now define <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \bigcap\Gamma\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a subset of every candidate relation. Now we will prove a series of claims about <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>First, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a candidate relation.</strong> Indeed, since <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> is in every element of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, it is in the intersection. Similarly, if <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> is in every element of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> but every element of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a candidate relation thus <span class="math inline">\((f(x), g(y))\)</span> is in every element of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\((f(x), f(y))\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Second, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the graph of a function,</strong> that is, for any <span class="math inline">\(x\in A\)</span> there is a unique <span class="math inline">\(y\in B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\in\gamma\)</span>. Define <span class="math display">\[
U = \{u\in A| \text{there is a unique $b\in B$ such that } (u,b)\in\gamma\}.
\]</span> We will show that <span class="math inline">\(U=A\)</span> using the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> allows <strong>PI</strong>.</p>
<p>Clearly <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\in\gamma\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a candidate relation. Suppose there is a <span class="math inline">\(b&#39;\in B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(b\neq b&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((a,b&#39;)\in\gamma\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;=\gamma\setminus\{(a, b&#39;)\}\)</span>. then we have <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in\gamma&#39;\)</span>. Moreover, if <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;\)</span> then so is <span class="math inline">\((f(x), g(y))\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\((f(x), g(y))\in\gamma\)</span>. Moreover <span class="math inline">\((f(x),g(y))\neq(a,b&#39;)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is not in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> by <strong>DA</strong>. We just proved that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;\)</span> is a candidate relation. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\subseteq\gamma&#39;\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the minimum candidate relation. But <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;\)</span> is obtained from <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> by removing an element. Contradiction. Therefore such a <span class="math inline">\(b&#39;\)</span> cannot exist and hence we must have <span class="math inline">\(a\in U\)</span>. This finishes the base case of induction.</p>
<p>Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span>. By the definition of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, there is a unique <span class="math inline">\(y\in B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\in\gamma\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a candidate relation, we also know that <span class="math inline">\((f(x), g(y))\in\gamma\)</span>. Now suppose there is a <span class="math inline">\(b\in B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(b\neq g(y)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((f(x), b)\in\gamma\)</span>. Define <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;=\gamma\setminus\{(f(x), b)\}\)</span>. Similar to the base case, we will prove that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;\)</span> is a candidate relation which, by the minimality of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, will imply a contradiction. Note that <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in\gamma&#39;\)</span> as the element we removed cannot be <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is not in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Now suppose <span class="math inline">\((x&#39;,y&#39;)\in\gamma&#39;\)</span>. We want to show that <span class="math inline">\((f(x&#39;), g(y&#39;))\in\gamma&#39;\)</span>. We know that <span class="math inline">\((f(x&#39;), g(y&#39;))\in\gamma\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a candidate relation. So the only way that <span class="math inline">\((f(x&#39;), g(y&#39;))\not\in\gamma&#39;\)</span> is that <span class="math inline">\((f(x&#39;), g(y&#39;))\)</span> is the element we removed from <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\((f(x), b)\)</span>. But if <span class="math inline">\((f(x&#39;), g(y&#39;)) = (f(x), b)\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(x=x&#39;\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective. This, in turn, would imply that both <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((x,y&#39;)\)</span> are in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span> we must have <span class="math inline">\(y = y&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(y&#39;) = g(y)\)</span>. But this is not possible as, by assumption, <span class="math inline">\(b\neq g(y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>By slightly abusing notation, we will write <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(a)\)</span> when referring to the unique <span class="math inline">\(b\in B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in\gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Third, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> satisfies the recursion equations,</strong> that is, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(a)=b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(f(x))=g(\gamma(x))\)</span>. Let us translate what we know about <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> expressed in relational notation to the functional notation. Since <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in\gamma\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(a)=b\)</span>. Also for any <span class="math inline">\(x\in A\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\((x, \gamma(x))\in\gamma\)</span> by definition. Thus, since <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a candidate relation, <span class="math inline">\((f(x), g(\gamma(x)))\in\gamma\)</span> and that translates to <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(f(x))=g(\gamma(x))\)</span>.</p>
<p>This means that we can take <span class="math inline">\(\varphi=\gamma\)</span> in the statement of <strong>DR</strong> if we can show that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the unique such function. So let us do that.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the unique such function.</strong> This is a simple application of <strong>PI</strong>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&#39;\colon A\to B\)</span> be another function satisfying equations in the statement of <strong>DR</strong>. Define <span class="math display">\[
E = \{e\in A| \gamma(e) = \gamma&#39;(e)\}
\]</span> By assumption <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(a)= b =\gamma&#39;(a)\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(a\in E\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x\in E\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[
\gamma(f(x))=g(\gamma(x))=g(\gamma&#39;(x))=\gamma&#39;(f(x)).
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\in A\)</span>. So by <strong>PI</strong> we are done.</p>
<h2 id="from-definition-by-recursion-to-dedekind-axioms">From Definition by Recursion to Dedekind Axioms</h2>
<p>Now let us go in te opposite direction. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A,f,a)\)</span> allows <strong>DR</strong>. Maybe somewhat surprisingly, the difficult part is showing that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\setminus\{a\}\)</span>. Proving that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> allows <strong>PI</strong> is almost immediate.</p>
<p>To make the argument easier to read, let us introduce a few notions. Given <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structures <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A,f,a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}=(B,g,b)\)</span>, a homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> is a function <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\colon A\to B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(a)=b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(f(x))=g(\alpha(x))\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in A\)</span>. In this terminology, an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> allows <strong>DR</strong> if an only if for any <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> there is a unique homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is an easy exercise to show that identity function is a homomorphism and composition of two composable homomorphisms is again a homomorphism.</p>
<p>Now back to <strong>PI</strong>. Let <span class="math inline">\(B\subseteq A\)</span> be a subset containing <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and closed under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. This makes <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}=(B,g, a)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g = f\vert_B\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure. So, by <strong>DR</strong>, there is a unique homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\colon A\to B\)</span>. There is also a homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\iota\colon\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{A}\)</span> defined by inclusion: <span class="math inline">\(\iota(x)=x\)</span>. Now <span class="math inline">\(\iota\circ\varphi\)</span> is a homomorphism from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> to itself. But <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> allows <strong>DR</strong> so by uniqueness of homomorphisms we must have that <span class="math inline">\(\iota\circ\varphi\)</span> is the identity function. But then <span class="math inline">\(\iota\)</span> has to be surjective meaning that <span class="math inline">\(B=A\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the rest, we will develop some rudimentary category theory. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> be a category and let <span class="math inline">\(F\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}\)</span> be a functor. An <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebra is a pair <span class="math inline">\((A,f)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an object of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\colon F(A)\to A\)</span> is a morphism of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. It may be difficult to see where the name ‘algebra’ comes from at first sight so let us first clarify that. The idea is that we can view <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> as a way to define an abstract signature. In the case of polynomial functors they do define signatures in the classical sense. The notion of an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure is an instance of this. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p>Consider the functor <span class="math inline">\(S(X) = 1 + X\)</span> from the category of sets to itself where 1 is a fixed terminal object –a singleton– and <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> is the coproduct of sets, that is, disjoint union. An <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-algebra is a function from <span class="math inline">\(f\colon 1 + A\to A\)</span>. Clearly <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is determined by two functions <span class="math inline">\(g=f\vert_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h=f\vert_A\)</span>. The domain of the function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a singleton so <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is determined by the unique element in its image. To summarize, an <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-algebra structure on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is determined by an element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a function from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Bu this is precisely what an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure is determined by.</p>
<p>We can also define a notion of morphism between <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebras. Let <span class="math inline">\((A, f)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((B, g)\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebras for some functor <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. A function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\colon A\to B\)</span> is called an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebra morphism if the following diagram commutes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c}
A &amp; \ras{\;\;\;\varphi\;\;\;} &amp; B \newline
\ua{f} &amp; &amp; \ua{g} \newline
F(A) &amp; \ras{\;\;F(\varphi)\;\;} &amp; F(B) \newline
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Clearly the following diagram commutes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c}
A &amp; \ras{\;\;\;{\rm id}\;\;\;} &amp; a \newline
\ua{f} &amp; &amp; \ua{f} \newline
F(A) &amp; \ras{\;\;F({\rm id})={\rm id}\;\;} &amp; F(A) \newline
\end{array}
\]</span> Therefore <span class="math inline">\({\rm id}\)</span> is a morphism from <span class="math inline">\((A, f)\)</span> to itself. Moreover if the small squares in the following diagram commute then the big rectangle commutes: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c}
A &amp; \ras{\;\;\;\varphi\;\;\;} &amp; B &amp; \ras{\;\;\;\psi\;\;\;} &amp; C\newline
\ua{f} &amp; &amp; \ua{g} &amp; &amp; \ua{h} \newline
F(A) &amp; \ras{\;\;F(\varphi)\;\;} &amp; F(B) &amp; \ras{\;\;F(\psi)\;\;} &amp; F(C) \newline
\end{array}
\]</span> Therefore composition of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebra morphisms is again an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebra morphism. We just proved that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebras form a category. We define an initial <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebra to be an initial object in the category of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebras.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-algebra morphisms correspond to homomorphisms of <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structures and being an initial <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-algebra corresponds to being an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure which allows definition be recursion.</p>
<p>Now comes a beautiful and surprisingly general theorem about initial algebras:</p>
<p><strong>Lambek’s theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be a functor and let <span class="math inline">\((A, f)\)</span> be an initial <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebra. Then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-algebra isomorphism from <span class="math inline">\((F(A), F(f))\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((A, f)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> be the unique morphism from <span class="math inline">\((A, f)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((F(A), F(f))\)</span>. Consider the following diagram: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c}
A &amp; \ras{\;\;\;\varphi\;\;\;} &amp; F(A) &amp; \ras{\;\;\;f\;\;\;} &amp; A\newline
\ua{f} &amp; &amp; \ua{F(f)} &amp; &amp; \ua{f} \newline
F(A) &amp; \ras{\;\;F(\varphi)\;\;} &amp; F(F(A)) &amp; \ras{\;\;F(f)\;\;} &amp; F(A) \newline
\end{array}
\]</span> The square on the left commutes by the definition of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>. The square on the right commutes trivially. Therefore the big rectangle commutes. This means that <span class="math inline">\(f\circ\varphi\)</span> is a morphism from <span class="math inline">\((A,f)\)</span> to itself so it must be <span class="math inline">\({\rm id}\)</span> because an initial algebra has only one endomorphism. Now consider <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\circ f\)</span>. Using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a functor and the square on the left commutes we obtain: <span class="math display">\[
\varphi\circ f = F(f)\circ F(\varphi) = F(f\circ\varphi)=f({\rm id}) = {\rm id}.
\]</span> This proves that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an isomorphism whose inverse is <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<p>Now let us see what this means for <span class="math inline">\(S(X)=1 + X\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}=(A,f,a)\)</span> be an <span class="math inline">\(\IN\)</span>-like structure which allows <strong>DR</strong>. Then the corresponding <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-algebra is <span class="math inline">\(c_a+f\colon 1+A\to A\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_a\)</span> denotes te constant function with value <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. By assumption it is an initial <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-algebra. By Lambek’s theorem <span class="math inline">\(c_a + f\)</span> is an isomorphism from <span class="math inline">\(1 + A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In particular, as viewed as a function, it is a bijection. The image of <span class="math inline">\(c_a\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must be a bijection from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\setminus \{a\}\)</span>. This proves that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> satisfies <strong>DA</strong>.</p>
