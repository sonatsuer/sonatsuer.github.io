<h2 id="function-sets">Function Sets</h2>
<p>Suppose we have two sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Can we name a function from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> without using what <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is? Obviously if <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is empty and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not empty then this is not possible as there is no function from a nonempty set to the empty set. So let us suppose <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are nonempty for the moment. Now there <em>are</em> functions from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. For instance, for every element <span class="math inline">\(y\in Y\)</span>, there is the constant function which takes the value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Bu this does not count because the problem is to <em>name</em> a particular function, not to prove the existence of such functions. It looks difficult. Actually, in a sense which we will define later, the answer is that we cannot name such a function. Considering the fact that we do not know anything about <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> this is hardly surprising.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we take <span class="math inline">\(X=Y\)</span> then it is possible to name such a function: the identity function. Since the identity function maps each element to itself, we do not need to know anything about <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Frankly, this does not seem like an interesting observation, either. However, as we consider more complex examples, the situation will change dramatically.</p>
<p>Let us introduce some notation. For sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we will denote the set of functions from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(X\to Y\)</span>. In this notation <span class="math inline">\(f \in X\to Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f \colon X \to Y\)</span> have the same meaning. For instance, if we denote the identity function on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(1_X\)</span>, then we have <span class="math inline">\(1_X \in X\to X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the following question: Can we name a function from the set <span class="math display">\[
  X \to (Y \to X) ?
\]</span> What we need to find is a function, which, given an element of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, produces a function from <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. After a moments thought, it is easy to come up with the function <span class="math inline">\(x\mapsto C_x\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C_x(y)=x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(y\in Y\)</span>. In other words, we can send <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the constant function which only attains the value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>In a similar way, one can easily see that <span class="math display">\[
  x\mapsto 1_Y \in X \to (Y \to Y).
\]</span> However, it seems that the problem has no solution for the sets <span class="math display">\[
  X \to (X \to Y) \;\;\;\text{ and }\;\;\; (X \to Y) \to Y
\]</span></p>
<p>We can consider even more complex examples. For instance <span class="math display">\[
  x\mapsto E_x \in X \to ((X \to Y ) \to Y).
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(E_x\)</span> is the ‘’evaluation at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’’ function, that is <span class="math inline">\(E_x(f) = f(x)\)</span>. Yet the problem has no solution for the set <span class="math display">\[
  X \to ((Y \to X) \to Y).
\]</span></p>
<p>As an exercise, you might want to name an element from the set <span class="math display">\[
  (X \to (Y \to Z)) \to ((X \to Y) \to (X \to Z)).
\]</span></p>
<p>After seeing all these examples, we have a somewhat vague but very natural questions: From which sets can we name specific elements? We will give a rather surprising answer to this question.</p>
<h2 id="propositional-calculus-with-only-implication">Propositional Calculus with only Implication</h2>
<p>After function sets, the title may remind you of the Monty Python Movie <em>And Now for Something Completely Different</em> but bear with me. I promise this is going somewhere.</p>
<p>In this section we will develop a modest theory of propositions. We are not going to define <em>what</em> a proposition is, but intuitively, we will think of propositions as judgments. The central notion in our theory will be that of proof, or rather the “proves” relation which we will denote by <span class="math inline">\(\vdash\)</span>. The proves relation will be a relation between proposition sets, which we will call assumption sets, and propositions. If <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a set of propositions and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a proposition we will write <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\vdash p\)</span> to denote <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> proves <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we will list the properties we want <span class="math inline">\(\vdash\)</span> to satisfy. These properties will be our deduction rules. For ease of notation we will abbreviate <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\cup\{p\}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma,p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\cup\{p,q\}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma,p,q\)</span>. We will also write <span class="math inline">\(\vdash p\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\vdash p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our first deduction rule is trivial: We can prove a proposition if it is among our assumptions. Formally, <span class="math display">\[
  \Gamma, p\vdash p.
\]</span> We will call this the rule <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the other deduction rules, we need to define how we can construct new propositions from old ones. There are several ways to do it. We can use conjunctions, disjunctions, negations, implications etc. For the sake of this post, we will only work with implication. If <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are two propositions then we define a new proposition <span class="math inline">\(p\to q\)</span> and read it as “<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>”. Obviously this is a completely formal definition.</p>
<p>Now we can introduce more deduction rules. The next rule is the famous <em>modus ponens</em> rule. It says if one can prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\to q\)</span> from an assumption set <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> then we can also prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. More formally we have <span class="math display">\[
  \text{if }\;\;\;\Gamma\vdash p\;\;\;\text{ and }\;\;\;\Gamma\vdash p\to q
  \;\;\;\text{ then }\;\;\;\Gamma\vdash q.
\]</span> We will call this the rule <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our final rule is kind of a dual version of modus ponens. It says that if one can prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> together with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> then using only <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> one can prove <span class="math inline">\(p\to q\)</span>. More formally <span class="math display">\[
  \text{if }\;\;\;\Gamma,p\vdash q\;\;\;\text{ then }\;\;\;\Gamma\vdash p\to q.
\]</span> We will call this the rule <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our propositional logic with the rules <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is called the implicational fragment of the intuitionistic propositional logic and sometimes denoted by <span class="math inline">\({\rm IP}(\to)\)</span>. So what can we deduce in <span class="math inline">\({\rm IP}(\to)\)</span>? Let us look at a few examples.</p>
<p>First of all, by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(p\vdash p\)</span>. So, by <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, we deduce <span class="math inline">\(\vdash p\to p\)</span>. On the other hand we should not have <span class="math inline">\(\vdash p\to q\)</span> because it is absurd to expect an arbitrary proposition to imply an arbitrary proposition. Actually it is not difficult to prove that we cannot deduce <span class="math inline">\(\vdash p\to q\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\({\rm IP}(\to)\)</span> but we will mostly rely on intuitive arguments.</p>
<p>Here is another example. By <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(p,q\vdash p\)</span>. By <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, we deduce <span class="math inline">\(p\vdash q\to p\)</span>. Using <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> once more we obtain <span class="math inline">\(\vdash p\to (q\to p)\)</span>. If we start with <span class="math inline">\(p,q\vdash q\)</span> in the previous argument we obtain <span class="math inline">\(\vdash p\to (q\to q)\)</span>. On the other hand we should not be able to deduce <span class="math inline">\(\vdash p \to (p\to q)\)</span>. Because assuming <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> holds, we cannot say that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> implies an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that we have not used the rule <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> yet. So let us look at an example involving that rule. Let <span class="math display">\[
  \Gamma=\{p,p\to q\}.
\]</span> First of all, by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\vdash p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\vdash p\to q\)</span>. Thus, by <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we deduce <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\vdash q\)</span>. Now using the rule <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> twice we get <span class="math display">\[
  \vdash  p \to ((p \to q) \to q).
\]</span></p>
<p>As an exercise, prove that <span class="math display">\[
  \vdash
   (p \to (q \to r)) \to ((p \to q) \to (p \to r)).
\]</span></p>
<p>Now let us list the propositions we were able to prove with an empty assumption set:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
&amp; p \to p, \newline
&amp; p \to (q \to p), \newline
&amp; p \to (q \to q), \newline
&amp; p \to ((p \to q) \to q), \newline
&amp; (p \to (q \to r)) \to ((p \to q) \to (p \to r)).
\end{align}\]</span>
Let us also list all the function sets from which we were able to name specific elements:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
&amp; X \to X, \newline
&amp; X \to (Y \to X), \newline
&amp; X \to (Y \to Y), \newline
&amp; X \to ((X \to Y) \to Y), \newline
&amp; (X \to (Y \to Z)) \to ((X \to Y) \to (X \to Z)).
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>Either we have a strange coincidence in our hands or we just observed a nontrivial relation between functions and propositions. In the <a href="curry-howard-2.html">next post</a>, we will see that this is not a coincidence.</p>
