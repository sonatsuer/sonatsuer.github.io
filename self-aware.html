<h1 id="a-classical-exercise">A Classical Exercise</h1>
<p>A computer program which produces its own source code is called a
quine, named after the logician Willard Van Orman Quine.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Write a quine in your favorite programming
language.</p>
<p>If you haven’t solved this exercise before, I urge you to stop right
now and give it a try.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why this is an interesting problem, let us try
to solve it in a naive way. Instead of using an actual programming
language I will use pseudocode to keep things simple.</p>
<p>The obvious candidate of a quine is</p>
<pre><code>Print your own source code</code></pre>
<p>This looks like cheating but actually there are languages which allow
this. For instance</p>
<pre><code>10 List</code></pre>
<p>is a valid GWBasic program which, when run, prints
<code>10 List</code> on the screen. Actually, in GWBasic, <em>any</em>
code which starts with <code>10 List</code> is a quine.</p>
<p>So, to make things less trivial and more generic, let us restrict
ourselves to text manipulations. In this case, the first candidate
is</p>
<pre><code>Print &quot;Print&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The output of this code is simply <code>Print</code>. So it doesn’t
work. Seeing this, you may try</p>
<pre><code>Print &quot;Print &quot;Print&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This time the output is <code>Print "Print"</code>. Failed again.
Actually, any code of the form
<code>Print "&lt;any kind of fixed text&gt;"</code> will fail as the
source code is strictly longer than the text it prints. Now here is an
idea to circumvent this: We can use the the given text, or its parts,
more than once! So let us try a program like this:</p>
<pre><code>Let A be the following text:
&quot;&lt;there is going to be a text here&gt;&quot;
&lt;there are going to be commands here explaining what to do with A&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As we will construct the source code using the parts of the text A,
the first line of the code should be a part of A. So our program should
look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Let A be the following text:
&quot;Let A be the following text:
&lt;there are going to be more lines here&gt;&quot;
&lt;there are going to be commands here explaining what to do with A&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Of course, we will print the first line. Thus we should have a
program like this:</p>
<pre><code>Let A be the following text:
&quot;Let A be the following text:
&lt;there are going to be more lines here&gt;&quot;
Print the first line of A
&lt;there are going to be more commands here&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Obviously the command <code>Print the first line of A</code> should
appear somewhere in A. So let’s add it to A to obtain</p>
<pre><code>Let A be the following text:
&quot;Let A be the following text:
Print the first line of A
&lt;there are going to be more lines here&gt;&quot;
Print the first line of A
&lt;there are going to be more commands here&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now the second printing command should print what comes after the
first line. But this is simply the text A in quotation. Therefore we
should have</p>
<pre><code>Let A be the following text:
&quot;Let A be the following text:
Print the first line of A
&lt;there are going to be more lines here&gt;&quot;
Print the first line of A
Print A in quotation
&lt;there are going to be more commands here&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Again these commands should appear in A. So we have</p>
<pre><code>Let A be the following text:
&quot;Let A be the following text:
Print the first line of A
Print A in quotation
&lt;there are going to be more lines here&gt;&quot;
Print the first line of A
Print A in quotation
&lt;there are going to be more commands here&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that, up until now, all the steps we took were pretty much
forced. The final step will be a little different and require a tid bit
of creativity. Here is our finished quine:</p>
<pre><code>Let A be the following text:
&quot;Let A be the following text:
Print the first line of A
Print A in quotation
Print A except for its first line&quot;
Print the first line of A
Print A in quotation
Print A except for its first line</code></pre>
<p>As an exercise, you may translate this quine into a real programming
language. Even though the quine above has the essential idea, you may
still need to deal with a few language specific details such as escaping
quotation marks. Here is one for you in Haskell meant to be evaluated in
repl.</p>
<pre><code>let x = [&quot;let x = &quot;, &quot; in putStr (x !! 0) &gt;&gt; putStr (show x) &gt;&gt; putStr (x !! 1)&quot;] in putStr (x !! 0) &gt;&gt; putStr (show x) &gt;&gt; putStr (x !! 1)</code></pre>
<p>Now this was fun, bu also ad-hoc. The natural question to ask here
whether there is a principled way of writing, not only quines, but
programs which have some kind of access to their own source code. The
answer is yes and this follows from one of the most fundamental results
in recursion theory, the recursion theorem.</p>
<h1 id="kleenes-recursion-theorem">Kleene’s Recursion Theorem</h1>
<p>I want to work with a Turing complete programming language. Luckily,
what we need is essentially what I described in the first section of <a
href="https://sonatsuer.github.io/kolmogorov-complexity/2018/05/21/kolmogorov-complexity-1.html">Kolmogorov
Complexity (1/2)</a>. The differences are that we do not need <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> to contain UTF-8 characters
and we do not need an assumption on the way we represent natural
numbers.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> be the set of
all strings from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> and
let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}(n)\)</span> be the set of
all source codes expecting <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
inputs, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a natural
number. Then, for each <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(n)\)</span>, we have a partial
function <span class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}^n\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>, which is simply the partial
function computed by the source code <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. These functions are called the
computable partial functions.</p>
<p>Let us start with a simple but useful lemma.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma:</strong> There is a computable function <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> such that for any <span
class="math inline">\(x\in\mathcal{M}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(2)\)</span> we have <span
class="math inline">\(s(c,x)\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> and <span
class="math display">\[
   f_c(x,y) = f_{s(c,x)}(y).
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let <span
class="math inline">\(x\in\mathcal{M}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(2)\)</span> be given. As <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(2)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Ask for a value from the user and store it as A
Ask for a value from the user and store it as B
&lt;Some commands&gt;</code></pre>
<p>All <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> will need to do is to
convert this code into the following one:</p>
<pre><code>Let A be x
Ask for a value from the user and store it as B
&lt;Some commands&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In other words, it should hard-code the value <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. It is not difficult to imagine an
algorithm doing this. Thus, by appealing to the Church-Turing
hypothesis, we are done. <span
class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Now we can prove the recursion theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Kleene):</strong> Let <span
class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> be a partial two-variable
computable function. Then there is a <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[
  f(c,y) = f_c(y)
\]</span> holds for all <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let <span
class="math inline">\(a\in\mathcal{C}(2)\)</span> be such that <span
class="math inline">\(f = f_a\)</span>. Such an <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> exists because this is what computable
means. Now, by the lemma, we already have something close, namely <span
class="math display">\[
  f(x,y) = f_a(x,y) = f_{s(a,x)}(y).
\]</span> So, if we could find a solution for <span
class="math inline">\(x = s(a,x)\)</span>, then we would be done.
However, in this equation, we have some control over <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> but the other parameter <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is very heavily constrained since <span
class="math inline">\(f = f_a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now comes the brilliant idea: instead of working with <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> let us work with a computable function
of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Consider <span
class="math inline">\(f(g(x),y)\)</span> for a not yet determined
computable function. As both <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are computable, so is this new
function. Therefore there is a <span
class="math inline">\(b\in\mathcal{C}(2)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f_b(x,y) = f(g(x),y)\)</span>. Now we have <span
class="math display">\[
  f(g(x),y) = f_b(x,y) = f_{s(b,x)}(y)
\]</span> so the equation we need to solve in this case is <span
class="math display">\[
  g(x) = s(b, x)
\]</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(x = s(a,x)\)</span>.
Introducing <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> into the problem gave
us some room because now we can choose both <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> <em>and</em> <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. Squinting at the equation for a few
seconds, we see that there is a trivial solution, namely <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = s(x,x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x = b\)</span>! We were lucky! (Just kidding, I
planned all of this.)</p>
<p>Let us summarize this “stream of consciousness” into a more
traditional proof. Let <span
class="math inline">\(b\in\mathcal{C}(2)\)</span> be such that <span
class="math inline">\(f_b(x,y) = f(s(x,x),y)\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(c = s(b,b)\)</span>. Then <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align}
f(c,y) &amp; = f (s (b,b), y) \newline
       &amp; = f_b (b, y) \newline
       &amp; = f_{s(b,b)}(y) \newline
       &amp; = f_c(y)
\end{align}\]</span> This finishes the proof. <span
class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Let us look at example to appreciate the power of this theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> There is a <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> such <span
class="math inline">\(f_c(y) = c\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Note that <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is just a quine. Let <span
class="math inline">\(f(x,y) = x\)</span>. Obviously <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is computable. Thus, by the recursion
theorem, there is a <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> such that
<span class="math display">\[
  f_c(y) = f(c, y) = c
\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here is another one.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> There is a <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> such <span
class="math display">\[
  f_c(y) =
  \begin{cases}
   \text{reversed } c, \text{ if $c$ is longer than $y$} \newline
   \text{collected works of Shakespeare}, \text{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\]</span> Let <span class="math display">\[
  f(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
   \text{reversed } x, \text{ if $x$ is longer than $y$} \newline
   \text{collected works of Shakespeare}, \text{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\]</span> and apply the recursion theorem.</p>
<p>The pattern here is clear: If you want to find a code in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> which accesses its own
source code, just write a code in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}(2)\)</span> which asks for its own
source code as input from the user. The recursion theorem takes care of
the rest. From now on, I will freely use a subroutine
<code>access your own code</code> and assume that you can implement it
using the recursion theorem.</p>
<h1 id="unsolvable-problems">Unsolvable Problems</h1>
<p>Now we know how to fake an access-your-own-code subroutine. You might
think that we can write amazing programs by using it but from a
practical point of view such a subroutine is pretty useless. So what can
we do with it? Well, mathematical logic of course! (See the last
paragraph of <a
href="https://sonatsuer.github.io/kolmogorov-complexity/2018/05/21/kolmogorov-complexity-1.html">Kolmogorov
Complexity (1/2)</a>)</p>
<p>As a warmup exercise, let us prove the unsolvability of the halting
problem using the recursion theorem. Of course there is a much simpler
proof via diagonalization but, as I said, this is a warmup exercise.
Suppose that the halting problem <em>is</em> solvable. This means that
the function defined by <span class="math display">\[
  f(c, x) =
  \begin{cases}
  \text{yes, }\, \text{if $c$ is in $\mathcal{C}(1)$ and $f_c(x)$ is
defined} \newline
  \text{no, }\, \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\]</span> is computable. Now consider the following algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>Ask for a value from the user and store it as X
Access your own code and call it S
if f(S, X) = no
  print &quot;I am not supposed to halt!&quot;
  Halt
if f(S, X) = yes
  print &quot;I am supposed to halt!&quot;
  loop forever</code></pre>
<p>This program looks at its code, and sees —using the function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>— whether it will halt, and then does
exactly the opposite. So it halts if and only if it does not halt!
Contradiction.</p>
<p>Before proving another impossibility result, let we will prove a
fixed point version the recursion theorem, sometimes called the second
recursion theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>
be a total computable function with a single variable such that <span
class="math inline">\(g(c)\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span>. Then there is a <span
class="math inline">\(S\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f_S = f_{g(S)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Such an <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is called a fixed
point of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code>Ask for a value from the user and store it as X
Access your own code and call it S
Simulate g(S) running on input X</code></pre>
<p>Let us call this code <code>S</code>, just like the program itself
does. Now for any given <code>X</code>, if we run <code>S</code> on
input <code>X</code>, we get what <code>g(S)</code> does on input
<code>X</code>. But this simply means that on any <code>X</code>, the
codes <code>S</code> and <code>g(S)</code> have the same behavior. So we
are done. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Now we can prove a classical result due to Henry Gordon Rice.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> be a decidable subset of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\not= \emptyset,
\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span>. Then there are <span
class="math inline">\(a,b\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(a\in \mathcal{A}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\in \mathcal{C}(1)\setminus\mathcal{A}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(f_a = f_b\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Fix <span class="math inline">\(a&#39;\in
\mathcal{A}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b&#39;\in
\mathcal{C}(1)\setminus\mathcal{A}\)</span>. Define <span
class="math display">\[
  g(c) =
  \begin{cases}
  a&#39;\text{ if } c\in\mathcal{A} \newline
  b&#39;\text{ if } c\not\in\mathcal{A}
  \end{cases}
\]</span> As <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is
decidable, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is computable. Let
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> be a fixed point of <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f_c =
f_{g(c)}\)</span>. Moreover, by construction, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g(c)\)</span> cannot be both in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. This finishes the proof.
<span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>This is a remarkable theorem, because it says that there is no
decidable semantic property! For instance the following sets are all
undecidable: <span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align}
  &amp; \{c\in\mathcal{C}(1) | \text{domain of $f_c$ has 73 elements}
\}, \newline
  &amp; \{c\in\mathcal{C}(1) | \text{$f_c$ is total} \}, \newline
  &amp; \{c\in\mathcal{C}(1) | \text{$f_c$ turns an even-length string
to an odd-length string} \}, \newline
  &amp; \{c\in\mathcal{C}(1) | \text{$f_c$ is constant} \}, \newline
  &amp; \{c\in\mathcal{C}(1) | \text{$f_c(x)$ has the characters a and 7
for all $x$} \}, \newline
  &amp; \{c\in\mathcal{C}(1) | \text{$f_c(x)$ is longer than $x$ for all
$x$} \}, \newline
  &amp; \ldots
  \end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>For our final example, we need a definition. Call an element <span
class="math inline">\(c\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> minimal if for any
shorter <span class="math inline">\(c&#39;\in\mathcal{C}(1)\)</span> we
have <span class="math inline">\(f_c \not= f_{c&#39;}\)</span>. It is
not difficult to prove that minimality is not a decidable property. I
will leave the details to you.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> Again, suppose that minimality <em>is</em> decidable
and consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code>Ask for a value from the user and store it as X
Access your own code and call it S
Construct a minimal M longer than S and call it W
Simulate W running on input X</code></pre>
